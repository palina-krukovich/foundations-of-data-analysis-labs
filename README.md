# Foundations of Data Analysis

1. Supervised Learning
   * Random forest
   * Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   * Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
   * One versus one (OVO)
   * One versus all (OVA)
3. Unsupervised Learning
   * Dimensionality Reduction
      * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   * Clustering
      * DBSCAN
      * K-Means
      * Hierarchical
      * Expectations maximization
   * Apriori Algorithm for Recommender Systems
